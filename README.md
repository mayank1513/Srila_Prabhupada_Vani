# Srila Prabhupada Vani

This is a very old project. I built it when I was just learning Android
and had no idea of version control system, code style/smell, testing etc.

This is working source code and optimised to reduce apk size while packing
in as many features as possible. While doing so, code readability is compromised.
But I hope it is understandable for someone having little experience developing
Android apps, knowledge of Android Studio features and some patience.
